# About

## Myself

Ryan enjoys butter tarts, explosions, and SPAAACE. Contrary to popular belief, I can't think in 7 dimensions.

## Privacy

I take privacy very seriously. However, I still want to see data about how my website is used.

The analytics is powered by [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/9YWAWS) (link contains a referral). What I can see is aggregated data such as:

* Website views.
* Average time spent.
* Pages visited.
* Referrers (where people came from to get here).
* Device types (phone, desktop, tablet).
* Browser.
* Country.

I do not have access to individualized data, and I do not set cookies.

## Design

This website was made using [the Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. You can download the template website code [here](https://github.com/peahatlanding/Webcomic-Jekyll-Theme).

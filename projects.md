# Projects

Most of my projects are kept on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Xierumeng).

## WARG Computer Vision

[WARG GitHub](https://github.com/UWARG/computer-vision-python)

Currently in development.

I am in charge of the Geolocation module, which maps pixel coordinates from a camera image to geographical coordinates in the world
given telemetry information (camera position, orientation, rotation, etc.).
The sub-project specifically involves constructing a projective perspective matrix from known coordinate pairs.
Once the matrix is constructed, any point of interest in the image can be mapped to the ground without having to trace a ray.

WARG: Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group.

## FTL Event Editor

[GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/FTL-Event-Editor).

Currently in development.

This is a user-friendly Windows program for modding the game FTL Faster Than Light.
Specifically, editing the XML data files for its story events.
It also contains a simulation feature for debugging purposes as patching and opening the game takes some time.

## UWaterloo Schedule Exporter

[GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/uwaterloo-schedule-exporter). [My published version (v1.9)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uwaterloo-schedule-export/kfdoehlfchipdmgngnabhaaggdmodgdk/). [Original published version (v1.6)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uwaterloo-schedule-export/epamhdpboimbcdgokgldffcdkfmbmajg).

Completed (at least until the next time Quest or iCal updates).

This is a Google Chrome extension that converts the class schedule on Quest into an iCalendar file,
which can then be imported into Google Calendar and/or Microsoft Outlook.
Originally developed by Baraa Hamodi, I took over as he has graduated and no longer has access to Quest.

## Space Combat Simulator

On hold.

This is a spaceship combat simulator on Windows, similar to KSP and Children of a Dead Earth,
based on mid-future speculative technologies.
Superconductors, nuclear fusion, and 3D printing are assumed to have matured and are common throughout this universe.
Research is being done to make it as realistic as I can make it
(implementing an 8th-order Gauss Jackson integrator is in the works).

## Personal Website

[Website](https://xierumeng.github.io). [GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/Xierumeng.github.io).

This is a place to link it all together (and somewhere to store my comics).

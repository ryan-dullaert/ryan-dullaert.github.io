# Projects

Most of my projects are kept on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Xierumeng).

## FTL Event Editor

Currently in development.

This is a user-friendly Windows program for modding the game FTL Faster Than Light. Specifically, editing the XML data files for its story events. It also contains a simulation feature for debugging purposes as patching and opening the game takes some time.

[GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/FTL-Event-Editor).

## UWaterloo Schedule Exporter

Completed (at least until the next time Quest or iCal updates).

This is a Google Chrome extension that converts the class schedule on Quest into an iCalendar file, which can then be imported into Google Calendar and/or Microsoft Outlook. Originally developed by Baraa Hamodi, I took over as he has graduated and no longer has access to Quest.

[GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/uwaterloo-schedule-exporter). [My published version (v1.8)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uwaterloo-schedule-export/kfdoehlfchipdmgngnabhaaggdmodgdk/). [Original published version (v1.6)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uwaterloo-schedule-export/epamhdpboimbcdgokgldffcdkfmbmajg).

## Space Combat Simulator

On hold.

This is a spaceship combat simulator on Windows, similar to KSP and Children of a Dead Earth, based on mid-future speculative technologies. Superconductors, nuclear fusion, and 3D printing are assumed to have matured and are common throughout this universe. Research is being done to make it as realistic as I can make it.

## Personal website

This is a place to link it all together (and somewhere to store my comics).

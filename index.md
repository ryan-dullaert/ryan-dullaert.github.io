# Welcome

This is my formal website, a hub to all of my other projects and a place to host my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. My anonymized personal website is [elsewhere](https://xierumeng.github.io/).

I apologize in advance for the broken navigation bar on mobile. Please use the navigation links below. The header leads back here to the front page. I will fix this when I have the time. If there are any other issues, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/Xierumeng.github.io).

I hope I make a good candidate!

Sincerely,

Ryan Dullaert

# Welcome

This is my formal website, a hub to all of my other projects and a place to host my r&eacute;sum&eacute;. My personal website (with blog, comics, etc.) is [here](https://xierumeng.github.io).

I hope I make a good candidate!

Sincerely,

Ryan Dullaert

P.S. If there are any website issues, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryan-dullaert/ryan-dullaert.github.io). My [other GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng) has all of my projects.
